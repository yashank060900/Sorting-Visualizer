# Sorting-Visualizer

We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. 
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because 
we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.


Thatâ€™s why I am making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through 
this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.
